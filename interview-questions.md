# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: 
I learned hash in Ruby in one of the lectures at the time that I attended a programming bootcamp. It is defined as a collection of keys and their values. An output of a hash is somewhat similar to an object in JavaScript, the difference is the look of the syntax. A hash uses symbol for the key and uses '=>' called hash rocket pointing to the value. Each pair is seperated by a comma and are inside curly braces{}. An example looks like below:
{:shirt=>3, :shorts=>2, :socks=>"2 pairs"}

Researched answer:
I found the same answers online. Furthermore, I also found that a hash has a default value of nil. This means that if what is being selected inside a hash is not existing it will return an output of nil.

2. What is a gem? 

Your answer: 
I have encountered gems when I learned testing in Ruby. Gem is the software package that contains a library of Ruby code. It makes it easier to access custom methods. To install it, we simply type in gem install and the gem name. One of the gems that I used in Ruby is a Test Drived Development process which is the RSpec gem.

Researched answer:
I found the same answer online and also found out a way to find the list of gems available which is by simply typing in gem list into the terminal.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer:
I have been expose to working with Ruby on Rails. It is a MVC framework. MVC stands for Model View Controller. It will allow you to create models, view  and manipulate information. Ruby on rails is coded in Ruby which makes it as an open-source code that allows for programmers to create database. 

Researched answer: From different sources online, I have read that Ruby on rails emphasizes coding by convention which means that developers can build framework swith flixibility and applies the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself which means it can use code multiple times.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: 
I have used relational database when finding an association between tables using a primary key. The structure is made up of rows and columns. One of the columns holds the Primary Key. This is commonly used in Structued Query Language or SQL.
So far, I have only been exposed to this kind of database.

Researched answer: As I have read resources online, there are quite a number of other kinds of databases. They are Centralized Database, NoSQL Database, Distributed Database, Could Database, Netwrok Database, Object-Oriented Database, and Hierchical Database.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer:
In a relational database, primary keys are the ones that links the tables. It is important because it determines the association between tables. In rails, the primary is automatically assigned preventing any duplicates.

Researched answer: As I have read from sources online, Primary key is a unique identifier of a table. It has to have unique values and cannot be empty or null or nil in Rails. Also, online it mentioned the importance of Primary key as something that will ensure low accessibility and it is the key used for queries, reading, modifying information.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

2. JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a text-based format similar to JavaScript format used to transmit data in web applications.

3. ERB: ERB stands for Embedded Ruby. It is a Ruby language that is embedded to HTML. It allows to easily generate text in any quantity from templates.

4. Params: Params is short for parameter. It is a variable that is used inside a function.

5. API: API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows two applications to communicate to each other. This also allows to add security access.
